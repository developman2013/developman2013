## Tech

### The main languages that I use in development almost every day:

- **C#** - ASP.NET (+ Core), Xamarin.Forms, Libraries and etc
- **XAML** - Xamarin.Forms Frontend language
- **TypeScript** - Angular 9+
- **Markdown** - I have to write such wonderful readme on something, right?
- **HTML/CSS/JS** - I use it in Angular projects, landing pages and other front-end stuff


### Other tech stuff for every day:

- **GIT** - If you see it... :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
- **Docker** - I can deploy a large solution from scratch
- **Bash** - You can't be a developer if you don't use this tool
- **GitHub Actions** - I use this to automate delivery: building docker images, publishing to the server, running autotests, etc
- **VS & VSC** - Just IDE's
